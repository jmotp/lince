Firmware for the Linked Industrial Controller platform

Repository to track firmware development of the Lince Platform. 

Lince is a development board designed around the TM4C129E microcontroller. It contains interfaces that enables it to connect, read and control industrial sensors and actuators according to IEC61131-2.

List of Interfaces: 

- 8 Isolated Digital Outputs (Divided by two logic levels, defined by the user, up to 48V)
- 8 Isolated Digital Inputs 12/24V
- 4 Analog Inputs which can be calibrated for up to 24V.
- 4 Analog Outputs via PWM
- 2 Independent CAN Interfaces (DB9 and screw terminals)
- 1 USB-C Connector for flashing, powering and communication
- 1 10/100 RJ45 Ethernet Connector 
- 1 RS-485 interface via screw terminals
- 1 SPI interface for up to 3 devices
- 1 I2C interface

Power and Development:

Lince can be powered via:
- Barrel Jack ( 5 to 48V)
- Screw Terminals (5 to 48V)
- USB-C (5V)
- CAN Screw Terminals and Connectors (12 to 24V)
